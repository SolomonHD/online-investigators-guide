# Online Investigators Guide

Online Investigators Guide provides researchers information on how to navigate their research by two ways.  The first way is to give the researchers
an unfiltered view of the PI Handbook. In this view the researchers will have full access to the entire PI Handbook and it is up to the researchers to
to figure out what sections applies to their research.  The second way is to give the researchers an filtered view of the PI Handbook, which is tailored
to their research.  In order to generate this view, researchers must login with their net-id/password and answer a survey. Once the survey has been
completed, an filtered view will be created and saved. This view will have all of the necessary steps required for the researchers to follow to complete
their research.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

* [Install rails](http://railsapps.github.io/installing-rails.html)   - Follow instructions here to install rails 5.+.
* [Install mysql server](http://www.mysqltutorial.org/install-mysql/) - Follow instructions here to install mysql server.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
git clone https://github.com/emory-lits-uit/online-investigators-guide.git
```
```
cd online-investigators-guide
```
```
rails db:migrate
```
```
rails db:seed
```
```
rails s -e local
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
